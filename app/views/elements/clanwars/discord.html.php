                        <p>Starcraft 2 has person versus person matches that represent each team of clan members. Each game will have series of games that are the best out of a number. The captains of each team will discuss the first map, and which either team loses, will decide the next map until a final decision is made of the winning team. 1 game per point, and games must equal an odd number of games.</p>
                        <p>We use discord to allow our players to opt into a clan match, and request to subsititue a player who cannot make the match. It's also used as a notification to be sent to your phone with you using any personal information regarding the players. See tutorials for notifications setup, or seek help from an Admin in discord.</p>

                <p>Winning wars is a Prestigous action that our great clan seeks. in these wars two clans are pitted against each other in a brawl to gain the most stars. wars can range from 15 vs 15 to 50 vs 50. How stars are achieved is quite simple, when attacking an enemy base, destroying 50% of the base is 1 star, Destroying the town hall is another star, and Total anhilation will result in 3 stars. Each player is granted 2 attacks to spend as he likes, and communication is key.</p>

<p>Discord allows us to communicate efficiently, whether its sending messages for a player to recieve when they log on, or talking about a plan. using discord, we can organize all of our members so that they use their attacks effectively to gain us maximum possible stars and crush the opposition. Using discord is what makes our clan so successful.</p>
