        <p>These are a way of setting up a series of hotkeys for your keyboard and mouse to use during games, or whenever the hotkey(s) is pressed.</p>

        <p><b>Setup Bindings</b> is the button at the top of Ventrilo's default software, and labeled as "->", then when clicked on the <b>Setup Binding Menu</b> will appear in front of you. <b>New</b> button is to create, or assign a binding to a specific hotkey by giving that hotkey a name to remember as a <b>binding</b> name. <b>Clone</b> is to copy a current binding in the select menu of listed <b>bind names</b>.<b>Delete</b> is to delete a bind that is currently selected in the list of <b>bind names</b>. <b>Add</b> is to create a bind, and in the image below will provide the next menu when that button is clicked.</p>

        <p><b>Remove</b> will delete the selected hotkey/function. <b>Edit Hotkey</b> is close to Add hotkey, except you're editing a current one that was created. The image above is for both Adding a hotkey, and editing a hotkey. Each function is a action that connects to the hotkey you've assigned it. By clicking into the hotkey box, you then assign the selected function above, with any keyboard or mouse button that is pressed, and the hotkey will display the button you've assigned to it; when done, click the ok button to save, and will appear on the previous menu. After you've configured all your hotkeys, click the Ok button from the previous picture to save all the configurations, otherwise closing or clicking cancel will drop any changes made during this session.</p>
