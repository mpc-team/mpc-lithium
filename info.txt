What is the site, MPC?

~Home~
	Events:
		>	Corresponds to entries in a Calendar. Events can be anything. Typically information
			about an Event is presented through the Forum (this way, Users may also comment on
			the Event).
	Announcements:
		>	Corresponds to general information to be conveyed to all Users. Typically used for
			exclamatory messages about "Clan War" victories, but may also be used for mentions
			of additions to the Clan or website.
Forums
	>	The backbone for leaving general comments about almost anything. Forum posts can easily
		be parsed and presented to serve any purpose. The Forums system provides a lot of utility
		to other areas of the site.
Community
	>	A basic navigation tool for Clans and Members that have registered with MPC. Users that
		have privileges (such as inviting another User to a Clan) should be able to use this as a 
		tool for maintaining their connections in the Community, as well as making new ones.
Profile
	>	Control panel for managing a User's account. Allows Users to select Games they play or make
		personal messages on their Wall for visitors to see.
